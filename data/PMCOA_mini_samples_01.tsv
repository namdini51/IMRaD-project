4531145	25935135	body	I	4	1	43	Computational modelling in physiology has contributed to many significant breakthroughs, but the models themselves have usually not become working tools for experimentalists nor even for other modellers outside the developer’s own group.	2.33
4531145	25935135	body	I	4	2	43	We provide here a practical implementation of one of the classic and most complete models of body fluid and acid–base regulation, and we give several examples of the use of the model.	4.65
4531145	25935135	body	M	4	7	43	The original article of Ikeda et al. ( |CR11| ) describes the details of the model, so we will not give a complete description here (the program code, Online Resource 01, given in the Electronic Supplementary Material and described in the Appendix, has all the explicit equations); our implementation closely follows the description in their article, especially in their diagrams of the seven blocks that constitute the model, namely, the circulation and body fluids (blocks 1, 3, and 4), respiration (block 2), and renal function (blocks 5, 6, and 7).	16.28
4531145	25935135	body	M	4	8	43	Initial values and many other details are given not only in the text but also on the diagrams and in the tables of the original article.	18.6
4531145	25935135	body	R	4	20	43	To demonstrate several interesting features of the model and also to show that the Berkeley Madonna implementation presented here is an accurate representation of the Ikeda et al. model, we show that it faithfully reproduces the results of four simulations whose results are shown in the figures of their article.	46.51
4531145	25935135	body	R	4	21	43	The BM codes used to generate the results of the following simulations are all provided as Electronic Supplementary Material (see Appendix).	48.84
4531145	25935135	body	D	4	30	43	Efforts towards reusability and interoperability have made progress in recent years, not only in the modeling of kidney physiology (Thomas |CR26| ) but also in the wider context of physiology and systems biology (Hunter et al. |CR10| ).	69.77
4531145	25935135	body	D	4	31	43	For instance, SBML (the Systems Biology Markup language) 1 (Hucka et al. |CR9| ) is widely used for metabolic networks and models of cell signal transduction, the CellML repository 2 contains several hundred marked-up legacy models (mostly at the level of membrane transport or signal transduction), the JSim Consolidated Model Database 3 indexes 73390 models across five archives, and annotation tools such as the RICORDO 4 resource (de Bono et al. |CR4| ) and the ApiNATOMY 5 (de Bono et al. |CR3| ) project now facilitate the sharing (and even the merging) of physiology and systems biology models.	72.09

2546412	18681970	body	I	4	2	205	This is considered to be the result of both decreasing enrolments in nursing education, and poor retention rates of those in the nursing workforce.	0.98
2546412	18681970	body	M	4	30	205	All working nurses in NSW must be registered with the NSW Nurses Registration Board. We begin by using aggregate figures based on this information and published by NSW Health.

2546412	18681970	body	D	4	157	205	The profile of the NSW nursing workforce shows a substantial increase during the late 80s followed by a small trend upward in the 90s. The slow growth in the overall nursing workforce over the 90s can originate from a reduction in entry into nursing, a reduction in retention of nurses or an increasing tendency to retire early (reduced retention among higher age groups).	76.59
2546412	18681970	body	D	4	158	205	It is important to recognise which of these forces is responsible for the relative slowdown in nursing employment as the recommended policy responses will differ.	77.07

4072654	24977037	body	D	4	227	240	Hoffman’s 2010 study cited a number of reasons why Canada should take its global health role more seriously: It has health systems and health research expertise, is the birth-place of evidence-based medicine, is the ‘globalization nation’ (a result of its open immigration policy giving it the highest per capita in-migration rate in the world), hosts the Global Health Security Initiative to strengthen preparedness for pandemic and other health related security threats, and “enjoys disproportionate membership in the world’s leading multilateral forums” [ |R23| ].	94.58
4072654	24977037	body	D	4	228	240	The 2011 CAHS report, which some saw as a potential lever to create a unifying strategy, given its expert development outside of the partisan corridors of politics, builds somewhat differently upon what Canada could offer to global health [ |R20| ].	95.0
5391807	28469291	body	I	4	1	141	Earthworms are the most abundant animal, by biomass, in most soils ( |sbref0140| ) and are responsible for providing numerous ecosystem services and functions ( |sbref0040| ) that benefit crop growth ( |sbref0025| ).	0.71

5391807	28469291	body	M	4	21	141	All 16 plots of the Long Term Straw Incorporation Experiment, described by |sbref0225| were surveyed.	14.89
5391807	28469291	body	R	4	67	141	Farmyard manure significantly (p < 0.001) increased the biomass of earthworms in the Broadbalk plots ( Fig. 2 a).	47.52
5391807	28469291	body	R	4	68	141	This increase was due to a significantly greater biomass and number of endogeic (p < 0.001), anecic (p < 0.05), mature (p < 0.01) and juvenile (p < 0.01) earthworms in the farmyard manure treatments (see Table A1, Table A2 ).	48.23

2781158	19997647	body	R	4	28	69	The regression revealed several sites in which the correlation between the two measures reached significance (P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons).	40.58
2781158	19997647	body	D	4	40	69	The results support the predicted link between the emotional impact of emotive images and changes of activity in the prefrontal cortex associated with specific drug challenge or electrode stimulation.	57.97
2781158	19997647	body	D	4	41	69	Thus, in subjects with a low emotional impact, activity measured as blood flow at a site in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex rose in patients with Parkinson's Disease and DBS electrode turned on, as it did in healthy subjects challenged with a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, while in patients of high impact, the activity at this site in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex declined when the electrode was turned on, as it did in healthy subjects of high impact challenged with the drug.	59.42

3087759	21573238	body	M	4	21	120	In order to explore public concerns regarding rapidly evolving H1N1 activity, we collected and stored a large sample of public tweets beginning April 29, 2009 that matched a set of pre-specified search terms: flu, swine, influenza, vaccine, tamiflu, oseltamivir, zanamivir, relenza, amantadine, rimantadine, pneumonia, h1n1, symptom, syndrome, and illness.	17.5
3087759	21573238	body	M	4	22	120	Additional keywords were used to examine other aspects of public concern, including disease transmission in particular social contexts (i.e., keywords travel, trip, flight, fly, cruise and ship ), disease countermeasures (i.e., keywords wash, hand, hygiene and mask ), and consumer concerns about pork consumption (i.e., keywords pork and bacon ).	18.33
3087759	21573238	body	R	4	57	120	The first data set consists of 951,697 tweets containing key words h1n1, swine, flu or influenza selected from the 334,840,972 tweets observed between April 29 and June 1, 2009 (because the size of the daily sample fluctuates, all results are reported as a percentage of observed tweets).	47.5
3087759	21573238	body	R	4	58	120	These influenza-related tweets represent at most just over 1% of the sample tweet volume, and this percentage declined rapidly over time even as the number of reported H1N1 cases continued to climb (see Figure 2 ).	48.33
3087759	21573238	body	D	4	80	120	Our results demonstrate that Twitter traffic can be used not only descriptively, i.e., to track users' interest and concerns related to H1N1 influenza, but also to estimate disease activity in real time, i.e., 1–2 weeks faster than current practice allows.	66.67
3087759	21573238	body	D	4	81	120	From a descriptive perspective, since no comparable data (e.g., survey results) are available, it is not possible to validate our results.	67.5

3093405	21589879	body	D	4	140	264	Human DDX3 was co-crystallized with AMP in the absence of nucleic acid and thus the available structure represents the “open” conformation of the protein, as opposed to the “closed” conformation observed for other DEAD box proteins in complex with RNA, which involves repositioning of subdomains 1 and 2 relative to each other to accommodate both RNA and ATP substrates |pone.0019810-Hogbom1|.	53.03
3093405	21589879	body	D	4	141	264	This fact, together with the presence of AMP and not ATP in the binding site of DDX3, did not allow to establish a role of domains V and VI in mediating the interactions with the β- and γ- phosphates of the nucleotide as seen in the RNA-bound structures of the VASA protein of D. melanogaster |pone.0019810-Sengoku1| or the human Dbp5 |pone.0019810-vonMoeller1|.	53.41

3583869	23460858	body	I	4	1	76	Identifying mechanistic associations between organism body size (mass), resource use and whole-ecosystem processes is central to predicting how different species and their ecosystems might respond to environmental challenges, or to other factors affecting body size and resource use (e.g. |pone.0057449-Ozgul1| ).	1.32
3583869	23460858	body	I	4	2	76	One theory that considers how organism size and resource needs affect abundance, and ultimately whole ecosystems processes, is the Energy Equivalence Rule (EER; |pone.0057449-Damuth1|, |pone.0057449-Damuth2|, |pone.0057449-Nee1| ; also described as the Energetic Equivalence Rule).	2.63
3583869	23460858	body	M	4	14	76	Density data were collected from published studies |pone.0057449-Johnson1|, |pone.0057449-Strahan1| for n = 68 species of Australian marsupial, spanning three orders of magnitude of body mass ( Table S1 ) that encompassed the full spectrum of extant marsupial sizes.	18.42

3583869	23460858	body	R	4	27	76	Importantly, the slopes for density-scaling regressions for marsupials that included data on BMR or FMR were not significantly different from the entire dataset (Density BMR interaction F 1, 64 = 0.004, P = 0.95; Density FMR interaction F 1, 64 = 0.001, P = 0.98).	35.53
3583869	23460858	body	D	4	34	76	Australian marsupials do not follow an EER according to the OLS-regressions of PEU based on either BMR or FMR ( Table 1 ).	44.74
3583869	23460858	body	D	4	35	76	Most importantly, a key feature of the EER is that the body-mass scaling exponents for density and energy turnover (BMR or FMR) should be a direct inverse of one another, yet for both BMR and FMR the scaling exponents did not demonstrate a reciprocal overlap with the scaling exponent for population density (see also |pone.0057449-Johnson1| ).	46.05

3842325	24312212	body	D	3	112	117	A reappraisal of various fossil avian remains from France and Switzerland leads to the conclusion that a quite large flightless bird of the family Phorusrhacidae was present in Europe at the end of the Middle Eocene, apparently after the extinction of another family of large terrestrial birds previously well represented in Europe, the Gastornithidae. The European phorusrhacids were in all likelihood derived from African forms, through dispersal across the Tethys Sea. Current stratigraphic evidence suggests that the presence of phorusrhacids was of short duration, apparently being restricted to the late Lutetian (MP14).	95.73

Why they failed to diversify and prosper in Europe, unlike what happened in South America where a considerable phorusrhacid radiation took place during the Cenozoic, is not completely clear, but the competition of placental carnivores may have played an important part |pone.0080357-Mayr2|.	96.58

6438639	30996517	body	I	4	2	139	Changes in species morphology, behavior, and physiology, presence or absence of taxa in a community, as well as the structure of the entire biotic community have all been used as indicators of stressors, both anthropogenic (pollution, land use changes) and natural (drought, flooding, etc.) (e.g., Richards and Ivey |CR65| ).	1.44
6438639	30996517	body	M	4	21	139	Tubers (i.e., nutrient-filled, clonal structures produced on underground rhizomes) were collected from two tributaries with populations of monoecious S. cuneata in the Red River Valley, Manitoba, in October 2013.	15.11
6438639	30996517	body	M	4	22	139	Tubers were cleaned with 5% bleach solution to remove harmful organisms (Hunter-Cario |CR42| ), rinsed with distilled water, and stored moist in Ziploc bags at 4 °C to induce dormancy (adapted from McIninch and Garbisch |CR50| ).	15.83
6438639	30996517	body	R	4	77	139	Comparison of plant traits among the three trials showed that plants grown in nutrient-enriched sediments were more productive than water-enriched and control trials (Table 1 ).	55.4
6438639	30996517	body	R	4	78	139	Of plants in the sediment trial, 87 and 100% produced emergent leaves and tubers, respectively.	56.12
6438639	30996517	body	D	4	103	139	When the emergent plant Sagittaria cuneata was grown under controlled conditions, extreme differences were observed between plants growing in nutrient-enriched sediment and those propagated in nutrient-enriched water or unamended control conditions.	74.1
6438639	30996517	body	D	4	104	139	Plants grown in nutrient-enriched sediments were much more productive.	74.82
